# Born2beroot
In this project we created a **Linux virtual machine** (using virtual box) without using a GUI.<br />
During this project we've learned about the following tasks:<br />
-Creating a Linux virtual machine with LVM partitioning and installing Debian 11 OS.<br />
-setting a strong password policy for users using the pam module.<br />
-using apt for package managment.<br />
-setting up a Firewall and modifying it to allow SSH connection to the machine through a certain port.<br />
-creating a logfile to log all the *sudo* commands.<br />
-writing a *bash* script to display certain information about the machine.<br />
-creating a *Cron job* to schedule and run our *bash* script.<br />
