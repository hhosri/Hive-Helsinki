# Born2beroot
In this project we had to creat a **Sorting Algorithm** to sort a given list of random integers (No duplications), with the least amount of operations<br />

*For this project the following restrictions apply:*<br />
-We can only use 2 Stacks for sorting<br />
-Operations are restricted to:<br />
*sa: swaps the first 2 elements in stack A*<br />
*sb: swaps the first 2 elements in stack B*<br />
*ra: rotate stack A*<br />
*rb: rotate stack B*<br />
*rab: rotate stack A and B*<br />
*rra: reverse rotate stack A*<br />
*rrb: reverse rotate stack B*<br />
*rrab: reverse rotate stack A and B*<br />
*pa: pushes the top of stack B to the top of stack A*<br />
*pb: pushes the top of stack A to the top of stack B*<br />
