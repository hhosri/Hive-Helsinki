**What is Hive?** :bee:<br />
[Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en) is a coding school in Helsinki, Finland that takes part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).<br />
It's a school that preps you to launch your future-proofed career.<br />
There are no teachers, lectures, or books at Hive. Instead, we learn coding together with other students and work on practical, real-life projects, through a gamified project based learning system.<br />
