# Libft
Re-coding some of the C standard library functions<br />
As a part of my studies at Hive Helsinki, our first projects were about re-creating some of the C Standard library functions, and also some other functions, in order to be used the for the rest of our studies, as substitues of the original functions.<br />


-Part 1-2:<br />
Recreating some of the standard library functions (string manipulation, memory manipulation, linked lists operations...)<br />
*Part 1 of libft is checked with norminette, tested and VALIDATED. :white_check_mark: :100:* <br />
*Part 2 of libft (linked lists functions) is checked with norminette, tested but NOT VALIDATED. :white_check_mark:* <br />

-Part 3 (ft_printf):<br />
Recreating Printf (without handling the formatting flags and floats)<br />
*Part 3 is checked with norminette, tested and VALIDATED. :white_check_mark: :100:* <br />

-Part 4 (get_next_line):<br />
Creating a function that takes any input text (file or stdin) and read/display one line at a time, regardless of the buffer size.<br />
*Part 4 is checked with norminette, tested and VALIDATED. :white_check_mark: :100:* <br /><br />

Run the **make** rule to generate the *libft.a* library. :keyboard:
